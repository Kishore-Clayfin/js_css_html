        Red deer are ruminants, characterized by a four-chambered stomach. Genetic evidence indicates that the red deer,
        as traditionally defined, is a species group, rather than a single species, though exactly how many species the
        group includes remains disputed.[3][4] The closely related and slightly larger American elk or wapiti, native to
        North America and eastern parts of Asia, had been regarded as a subspecies of red deer, but recently it has been
        established as a distinct species

        The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest living cat species and a member of the genus Panthera. It is most
        recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange fur with a white underside. An apex predator, it primarily
        preys on ungulates, such as deer and wild boar. It is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator,
        requiring large contiguous areas of habitat to support its requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring.
        Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two years and then become independent, leaving their mother's home
        range to establish their own.
