    <h2>ANIMAL :</h2>
    <p id="p1">Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms in the biological kingdom Animalia. With few exceptions, animals
        consume organic material, breathe oxygen, are able to move, can reproduce sexually, and go through an
        ontogenetic stage in which their body consists of a hollow sphere of cells, the blastula, during embryonic
        development. Over 1.5 million living animal species have been described—of which around 1 million are
        insects—but it has been estimated there are over 7 million animal species in total. Animals range in length from
        8.5 micrometres (0.00033 in) to 33.6 metres (110 ft). They have complex interactions with each other and their
        environments, forming intricate food webs. .
